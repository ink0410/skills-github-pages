# About Me

Hello! I'm a first-year master's student at **Xidian University** in Xi'an, China. My academic journey began here as well, as I completed my undergraduate studies at Xidian University. I'm passionate about **biomanufacturing** and **embodied intelligence**, and this blog is a space where I share my thoughts, projects, and discoveries in these exciting fields.
