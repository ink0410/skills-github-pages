# About Me

Hello! I'm a first-year master's student at **Xidian University** in Xi'an, China. My academic journey began here as well, as I completed my undergraduate studies at Xidian University. I'm passionate about **biomanufacturing** and **embodied intelligence**, and this blog is a space where I share my thoughts, projects, and discoveries in these exciting fields.

## Education

- **Master of Science** in CS, Xidian University (Expected Graduation: 2027)
- **Bachelor of Science** in CS, Xidian University (Graduation: 2025)

## My Interests

### Biomanufacturing

Biomanufacturing is the use of biological systems to produce materials, chemicals, and other products. It's a rapidly growing field with applications in medicine, agriculture, and environmental sustainability.

### Embodied Intelligence

Embodied intelligence refers to the idea that intelligence emerges from the interaction between an agent (like a robot) and its environment. It's a fascinating area of research that combines robotics, artificial intelligence, and cognitive science.

## Recent Projects

### Project 1: Bioprinting Tissues

I've been working on a project to bioprint functional tissues using 3D printing technology. The goal is to create tissues that can be used for medical research and potentially for organ transplants.

### Project 2: AI-Driven Robotics

Another project involves developing AI algorithms for robots to learn and adapt to their environments. This is a step towards creating more autonomous and intelligent machines.
